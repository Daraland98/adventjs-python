'''The elves are playing with a magical train ðŸš‚ that carries gifts. This train moves on a board represented by an array of strings.

The train consists of an engine (@), followed by its carriages (o), and must collect magical fruits (*) which serve as fuel. The movement of the train follows these rules:

You will receive two parameters board and mov.

board is an array of strings that represents the board:

Â· @ is the train's engine.
Â· o are the train's carriages.
Â· * is a magical fruit.
Â· Â· are empty spaces.

mov is a string that indicates the next movement of the train from the train's head @:

Â· 'L': left
Â· 'R': right
Â· 'U': up
Â· 'D': down.

With this information, you must return a string:

Â· 'crash': If the train crashes into the edges of the board or itself.
Â· 'eat': If the train collects a magical fruit (*).
Â· 'none': If it moves without crashing or collecting any magical fruit.

Example:'''

from typing import List, Literal

def move_train(board: List[str], mov: Literal['U', 'D', 'R', 'L']) -> Literal['none', 'crash', 'eat']:
    directions = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}
    dx, dy = directions[mov]
    flat_board = ''.join(board)
    head_pos = flat_board.index('@')
    cols = len(board[0])
    head_x, head_y = divmod(head_pos, cols)
    new_x, new_y = head_x + dx, head_y + dy
    if not (0 <= new_x < len(board) and 0 <= new_y < cols):
        return 'crash'
    new_cell = board[new_x][new_y]
    return {'o': 'crash', '*': 'eat'}.get(new_cell, 'none')

# index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, or -1 if not found.
# divmod(): Divides two numbers and returns a tuple with the quotient and remainder.
# get(): Retrieves the value for a key in a dictionary; returns a default value if the key is not found.

board = ['Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·', '*Â·Â·Â·Â·', '@Â·Â·Â·Â·', 'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·', 'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·']

print(move_train(board, 'U'))
## âžž 'eat'
## Because the train moves up and finds a magical fruit

print(move_train(board, 'D'))
## âžž 'crash'
## The train moves down and the head crashes into itself

print(move_train(board, 'L'))
## âžž 'crash'
## The train moves to the left and crashes into the wall

print(move_train(board, 'R'))
## âžž 'none'
## The train moves to the right and there is empty space on the right
